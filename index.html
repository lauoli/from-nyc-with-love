      <h1>Diaspora Storm Relief: For Puerto Rico, With Love</h1>

        The landfills in Puerto Rico were already stressed before Hurricane Maria thrusted debris onto every corner and motivated the delivery of tons of aid to the island.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alarmed by the amount of trash the relief aid would generate, a group of Puerto Rican artists based in New York took a proactive approach to the hurricane aid. They created the Eco Kit, a relief kit with items that were selected with an eye towards PuertoRico’s
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kits included items that would aid people’s livelihood after Hurricane Maria such as solar powered battery banks, solar lamps, water filters, crank radios, seeds, and car power inverters.

        “Anything canned is the same as distributing water bottles, it will serve an immediate purpose but once you open the can and eat the contents or drink the water, it’s gone,” said Aris Mejías, an actress and one of the Eco Kit’s coordinators. “We are not
        asking for breadcrumbs, we are asking for people to be able to do things for themselves without the need from support.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      At a time where supplies were languishing in the ports of Puerto Rico due to transportation problems, Eco Kits were getting through. Getting these kits to the island required coordinating volunteers flying from New York to stuff kits into their luggage.
      The kits were later picked up by Eco Kit volunteers who would in turn deliver them directly to the communities in need. “It proved to be the most effective way to send,” said Mejías, 38. “A lot of the first things that arrived to Puerto Rico were
      literally carried on people’s backs, including our kits.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Hurricane Maria was just gaining steam far from the coasts of Puerto Rico when Mejías, who lives in Brooklyn, heard the weather reports. She got a team together and by the time Hurricane Maria entered Puerto Rico through the East coast, Eco Kit was already
      running. The initiative was coordinated by Mejías, Yaraní del Valle, and Jeca Rodríguez from New York while team member Isabel Gandía worked on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had started to assemble the kits in del Valle’s living room but soon outgrew it so the Loisaida Center, a community center in the East Village, offered them a bigger space. By partnering with ISER Caribe, a nonprofit ecological organization on Puerto
      Rico, Eco Kit was able to receive donations to fund the cause. So far, the initiative has received almost $25,000 and has delivered 50 kits to the island.

      Yaraní del Valle, 40, who worked as a community-based artist for 10 years in Puerto Rico, served as the link between the initiative and different community organizations on the island. She would spend entire days on the phone talking to organizations
      in Puerto Rico to identify needs and tailor the kits accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first weeks after the hurricane, when the island was without power, the kits helped journalists from the Center of Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico, a nonprofit that promotes investigative journalism, to report what was happening on the
      island. Reporters drove to pockets of the island where cell towers were functioning to find cellphone signal and communicate. Camped on the side of the road, reporters hooked up their computers to the car battery using the inverter provided by Eco
      Kit to be able to produce and publish their work said Carla Minet, the Director of the Center of Investigative Journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Arturo Massol, the director of Casa Pueblo was one of the first people that received the kit. Realizing that the solar powered lamp provided was of great use, he decided to call upon the organization’s extended network to collect a sizable number
      of lamps. Casa Pueblo has already distributed lamps to 3,500 families in Adjuntas, a town in the center of the island. Two months after the hurricane roughly half of the island is still without power.
